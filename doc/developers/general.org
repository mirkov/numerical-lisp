#+title: General notes about Numeric Lisp (NL)

* Relation between NL, CL, and Antik

  Much of NL reference implementation will derive from Antik.  In
  fact, a primary goal is to derive NL from the Antik code base, and
  then for Antik to be re-built around NL.  The hope is that this will
  allow other functionality to relativly easily build both on top and
  along Antik's.

** Comments (TonyRossini)

  One question that arises is whether having xarray-style matrix-like
  manipulation would be worthwhile, or using affi and grid style
  manipulation.  Since they originally derived from the same author,
  they are similar in nature, but they also were designed at different
  evolutionary stages of the author's programming practice.

* Packages

  NL introduces the NL package.  This package redefines math, array
  creation, and array access functions.  It also permanently shadows
  the symbols CL:FIRST, CL:SECOND, ... CL:TENTH.  Some of those are
  replaced by new symbols, (SECOND, THIRD, FIFTH, TENTH)

  These namespaces can be used directly, in which case the shadowed
  CL symbols can be accessed using the CL package designator.
